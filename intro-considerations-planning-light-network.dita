   <title>Examples</title>
   <ul>
    <li>If you only have one light bulb you might want to place it in a central location that would
     be optimum for turning on and off when you are away or arrive home.</li>
    <li>If you have multiple light bulbs, you might want to set them up in rooms and lighting groups
     to be able to better manage them across your home.</li>
   </ul>
